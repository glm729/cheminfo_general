# General ChemInfo Repository
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### 6<sup>th</sup> of May, 2021


This repository is designed to hold a variety of content generally associated
with or held within ChemInfo views.  As such, it's more for common storage and
backup than project management, but also permits greater visibility of code
produced, to the public and to other staff or collaborators.  Details on the
ChemInfo project can be found [here][1].  The functionality of ChemInfo is
primarily based on the [Visualizer project][2].

All of the work currently held in this repository was produced under contract
to the Australian National Phenome Centre, Murdoch University.

File and variable naming and documentation may be rather patchy!  Please [post
a ticket][3] if you think there is something I should clarify or improve.
Furthermore, considering I'm fairly new to web development in general, I may be
somewhat unconventional in my methods, so any guidance or recommendations are
most welcome.
