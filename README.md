# General ChemInfo Repository
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### 17<sup>th</sup> of March, 2021

This repository is designed to hold a variety of content generally associated
with or held within ChemInfo views.  As such, it's more for common storage and
backup than project management, but also permits greater visibility of code
produced, to the public and to other staff or collaborators.  Details on the
ChemInfo project can be found [here](https://cheminfo.org/).  The functionality
of ChemInfo is primarily based on the [Visualizer
project](https://github.com/npellet/visualizer).

All of the work currently held in this repository was produced under contract
to the Australian National Phenome Centre, Murdoch University.

File and variable naming and documentation may be rather patchy!  Please [post
a ticket](https://github.com/glm729/cheminfo_general/issues/new) if you think
there is something I should clarify or improve.  Furthermore, considering I'm
fairly new to web development in general, I may be somewhat unconventional in
my methods, so any guidance or recommendations are most welcome.
